## Reasons Why CS 193 Is Essential for CS and DS Students

### CS 193 Defined
CS 193 or CS 19300 is known as the Tools class for CS/DS majors. These majors have a lot of coding involved, most of which occurs in various dedicated platforms.

#### So Why is CS 193 Essential??

- Great TAs who have taken CS and DS courses before and are able to help you know what to expect based on their experiences.
- A way to focus on how the tools and programs used in CS/DS work apart from learning how to code in CS 180.
- Can ask questions and feel comfortable speaking to people who are closer to your age range.
